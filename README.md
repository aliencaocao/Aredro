**Before reporting**: Please ensure that you have the lastest version of Aredro, as we might have already fixed that bug you found in a new version :)

Each and every received bug report will be credited* right after the bug itself.

The tag [DEV] means this bug is found by a developer. Bug(s) highlighted in green means the bug has been fixed.

*_Some of the bug reports may be credited as “anonymous” as he/she chose to not to reveal his/her identity._



1. App crashes when trying to open the register screen. This bug only occurs on some systems, including most Android 5 systems. (Reported by [DEV]Cao Yuxuan)
2. When submission failed in “add items” page, the notification will show number “0” instead of the error message. (Reported by [DEV]Cao Yuxuan)
3. The time shown in the “check items” and “check orders” page will be UTC time, which is 8 hours later than SG time. We cannot fix this bug so far. (Reported by Ma Xundong/Class 1.2 CHS)
4. There is a black dot (full-stop) appearing above table in “Check Items” page. (Reported by [DEV] Cao Yuxuan)
5. On some devices, the buttons in the app will be white coloured instead of black and hence the white text in it cannot be seen. If on your device the buttons are white-coloured, please report it to us [here](https://goo.gl/forms/HUxzzFuOqp5Slw373). (Reported by [DEV] Aloysius Lam)
6. The very left edge of the screen is not responsive in the app. It is due to the new-added sidebar. We apologise that we so far cannot fix this issue. [Reported by [DEV] Cao Yuxuan)

# FAQ (Frequently asked questions) {#faq-frequently-asked-questions}

**Q1.** How do I check the android version for my device?

A1. Open “Settings”, find “About device” (usually at the bottom of the list), click, find “Android Version” or a similar list item. The number displayed there (x.y or x.y.z) is the Android version number.

**Q2.** How do I know that I have gotten the latest version of Aredro?

A2. Get the installed version number of Aredro (refer to [Q3](#bookmark=id.offhrh98om0z)), go to [official download page](https://sites.google.com/view/aredro/download), check if the installed version number matches the displayed “latest version” number in the website.

**Q3.** How do I know the current installed version of Aredro?

A3. 3 ways. Method 3 only works for some systems.



1. 👍Open Aredro, click “about” at the bottom of the login screen. The version number is shown within a grey strip on top. **The number behind “App Version-” is the installed app version, not the one behind “build”.**
2. Open “Settings”, find “App”, click and opens up a list of installed apps, find Aredro, click into the detail page. The version number is right below the App logo & name at the top.
3. Find Aredro icon on your screen (clicking which will open Aredro), press and hold till a menu appears on top of the screen. Find the menu item “App Info” and drag the app into it. It will open up the detail of Aredro, the version number is right below the App logo & name at the top.

**Q4.** There is a new version available, so how do I update the app?

A4. Go to [official download page](https://sites.google.com/view/aredro/download), click on the link behind “Latest version” at top of the web page. You will be redirected to the APK file shared on Google Drive. Click download. After downloading, open the downloaded APK file and follow the instruction on screen. **Please ONLY download from our official website!**

**Q5.** What is an APK file?

A5. An APK file (Application Package) is an installer for Android® apps. Hence it can only be opened on Android® devices. To install the app from a APK file, simply click to open it and follow instructions on screen. After installing the app, you may delete the APK file to free up storage space as it will not be needed anymore.

**Q6.** How much data will Aredro use if I turn on mobile data?

A6. VERY LITTLE. Result of testing: Register+Login+Check Item+Place an Order uses a total of at most 50KB of data. 

*(1 GB=1024 MB; 1 MB=1024 KB ∴50 KB=4.76837158203125e-5% GB:)

**Q7.** Do I have to use Aredro in school for ordering?

A7. Of course you do not have to! Although Aredro serves HCI for now, it is NOT limited to HCI wi-fi, unlike iTAP attendance taking app (NO OFFENCE!). **You may use ALL functions of Aredro at any where, as long as there is internet access.**

**Q8.** What if I encountered a problem while using Aredro but not sure if it is a bug or caused by my incorrect way of using Aredro?

A8. No worry! Fill in the [feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/hcd1FPBQSp8hBcyz1) and we will get back to you if it is not a bug with Aredro. If it is a bug, we will list it in the “[Known bugs list](#known-bugs-glitches)” and will try to fix it. Choose category “I need help” when filling up the feedback form.

**Q9.** I am a councillor. How do I obtain the Manager Pin to register as a Manager?

A9. You should have already known the Manager Pin when we release the app to you. If not, drop us a short email stating your name & class. Once we confirm that you are a councillor or person-in-charge, we will email you the Manager Pin.

**Q10.** If I want to write an email to the development team, do I have to take note of anything?

A10. Include your name & your app version number (refer to [Q3](#bookmark=id.offhrh98om0z)) **if **it is an issue with the app. Write to us at [aredrois@gmai.com](mailto:aredrois@gmai.com). Feel free to use any email account you like (not necessarily school gmail) **as long as we can get back to you if needed. Trollers/spammers will be blacklisted and reported.**

**Q11.** Do I have to be serious about the orders?

A11. **No. **Due to time limit, you do not have to pay for thing you have ordered. However, please do NOT spam, or you will be banned from future testing. 

**Q12. **Why cannot I find and download Aredro from Play Store?

A12. We are very sorry about that, but for it to be on Play Store, we need to pay $ to apply and wait for a rather long time. If the app gets more popular, we will consider uploading it onto Play Store.

**Q13.** What is the Source Code?

A13. It is literally the code of the app. It not only includes the code of the app itself, but also other parts that are crucial for the app to function but is not seen when using the app (e.g. backend database). To obtain the source code basically means to know how did we developed the app and how does it works, from the code’s perspective. However, [T&Cs](#bookmark=id.39rvnalqarnn) apply if you would like to obtain Source Code.

**Q14. **How can I obtain the Source Code for Aredro?

A14. Go to [official source code web page](https://sites.google.com/view/aredro/development/source-code) and follow the instructions on it.

Please note that T&Cs apply as mentioned in [Terms & Conditions](#bookmark=id.39rvnalqarnn) section.

**Q15.** Is there an iOS version of Aredro for iPhone users?

A15. Not yet. Due to our limited time and development skill, we only managed to develop the Android® version. If we are continuing this project next year, we may develop the iOS version as well. Stay tuned!

Q16. My device alerts me that the file may damage my device when I am downloading from the given website. So is it safe at all?

A16. YES. It is completely normal for your device to alert you as such. The file you are downloading is an APK file (refer to [Q5](#bookmark=id.j8mxi5yqkudu)), and it is straight from a webpage, hence there could be chances when you download a virus. However, **please be assured** that the files **on our website** **does not** contain any harmful software.

If you would like to suggest a FAQ entry, feel free to feedback to us [HERE](https://goo.gl/forms/hcd1FPBQSp8hBcyz1).

If you have any other questions, feel free to drop us an email (refer to [FAQ Q10](#faq-frequently-asked-questions)) and we will reply if needed.
